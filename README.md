This project was created following the instructiones provided by Parapaquetes. The purpose of this project is to deploy a webpage that will allow the user to check all the pending orders. Within each order he can find all products with the name, sku, quantity and price of each one. It also contains the shipping and billing information, aswell as the total costs of the orders. The user is able to see all the order's information, add more products and finally confirm and pay the order.
